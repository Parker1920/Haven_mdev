pytest Program-tests/Control-Room/Database/
```

### Using Test Manager UI
Launch from Haven Control Room → Advanced Tools → Test Manager

## Adding New Tests

1. Place test script in appropriate category/subcategory folder
2. Test will automatically appear in Test Manager UI
3. Follow naming convention: `test_*.py` for pytest compatibility

## Notes

- All tests use relative imports and are location-independent
- Tests automatically adjust paths using `Path(__file__).parent`
- Pytest configuration remains in `tests/conftest.py`
- Test data files remain in original locations (STRESS_TESTING.json, etc.)
