QUICK DECISION MAKER

Start with Phase 1 backups (1 day work) to:
  - Protect your data (most important)
  - Build confidence in automation
  - Learn the process
  - Create foundation for rest

Then continue with monitoring, reports, API, dashboard.
(20-25 hours total for full Phase 1)

---

SUCCESS METRICS

After Phase 1:
  System stable 24/7
  Backups tested and working
  Can access from web
  Can see system health

After Phase 2:
  Accessible from 4+ interfaces
  Real-time updates working
  Users adopting new features

After Phase 3:
  Anomalies detected
  Patterns identified
  Recommendations given
  Analytics valuable

After Phase 4:
  Professional experience
  Hardware providing feedback
  Automated deployment
  Advanced ML features

MOST IMPORTANT LESSONS

1. Backups are critical - do this first
2. Test everything on the actual Pi
3. Phases must complete in order
4. User feedback drives prioritization
5. Start small, iterate, scale up
6. Documentation and monitoring are critical
