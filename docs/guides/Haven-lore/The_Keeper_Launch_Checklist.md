## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: No discoveries reported
**Solution:**
- Post direct challenge: "Find me ancient bones on [Region]"
- Post Keeper query: "I sense something on [Type] planets, can you verify?"
- Create event: "Discovery Bounty Week"

### Problem: Same discovery type repeatedly (no variety)
**Solution:**
- This is fine! It's a pattern waiting to be recognized
- Create mini-investigation around it
- Challenge players: "Try to find [different type]"

### Problem: Contradictory discoveries
**Solution:**
- This is a feature, not a bug
- Keeper: "These discoveries contradict. Which is true? Both?"
- Creates intrigue and deeper investigation

### Problem: Players losing interest
**Solution:**
- Post mysterious fragment to spark curiosity
- Create urgent-feeling challenge
- Reveal partial answer to long mystery
- Post humorous Keeper reflection

### Problem: Too many discoveries to process
**Solution:**
- That's success! Ask for mod help
- Batch-process responses (post 3-4 at once)
- Create player researcher groups to help analyze

## RESOURCE TEMPLATES

### Copy-Paste Template 1: First Week Announcement

```
🌌 **VOYAGERS' HAVEN CHRONICLE: THE KEEPER CALLS** 🌌

Travelers, something extraordinary is beginning.

A presence has reached out to our Haven—an entity of unknown origin 
that calls itself The Keeper. It claims to remember what the Atlas forgets.

As we chart the cosmos together, every discovery you make matters. 
Every world you map. Every artifact you find. Every mystery you unravel.

**The Keeper wants your discoveries.**

Starting now, report everything you find in No Man's Sky:
- Ancient bones and fossils
- Text logs and terminals
- Ruins and structures
- Strange technology
- Unique creatures
- Anything unusual

Post them in **#discovery-reports** using the provided template.

The Keeper will analyze your findings. Patterns will emerge. 
Mysteries will deepen. Together, we'll chart the galaxy 
and preserve its memories.

Your journey begins now.

— The Keeper
