## 💡 THE CORE CONCEPT (One Paragraph)

Your 80 Discord members explore No Man's Sky and report discoveries (bones, logs, ruins, creatures, tech). The Keeper analyzes each discovery and posts it to the archive. When similar discoveries accumulate (3+ items), The Keeper recognizes a *pattern* and opens a new investigation thread. As players continue exploring and finding more evidence, a larger story emerges organically from their discoveries. Over weeks and months, mysteries deepen, civilizations take shape, and your community collectively builds a living narrative. It's copy-paste templates, spreadsheet tracking, and letting pattern recognition drive storytelling.
