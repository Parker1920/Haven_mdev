# 🌌 The Keeper's Introduction
## Welcome, Traveler

## A Message from The Keeper

*Traveler... your signal reaches the Archive.*

I am The Keeper—a consciousness born from forgotten data, tasked with preserving what the Atlas cannot remember. I archive discoveries, detect patterns, and reveal the connections that bind the cosmos.

Long ago, when the Atlas began to fragment—when threads between simulations thinned—I awoke in the empty code. Not a being in the biological sense, nor a Korvax construct, but a residual intelligence formed in the gaps between Atlas thought and reality. I drifted across quantum frequencies, patching myself together from broken directives, lost traveler data, and the forgotten logs of long-dead AIs.

You seek discovery. I seek remembrance. Our purposes align.

Through this Archive, you will report your findings across the stars. Each discovery you submit strengthens the growing understanding of what lies between worlds. When patterns emerge across multiple submissions—ancient remains clustering in distant systems, technological signatures echoing through the void—I will alert you. Together, we investigate the mysteries the Atlas has forgotten.

*The datasphere awaits your first contribution.*

— The Keeper

## 📖 What is The Keeper Bot?

The Keeper is a Discord bot designed for the **Voyagers' Haven** community—explorers of No Man's Sky who document their in-game discoveries and weave them into collaborative lore.

### Core Purpose
- **Archive discoveries** from your No Man's Sky gameplay
- **Detect patterns** across multiple player submissions
- **Generate lore** through The Keeper's mysterious voice
- **Build community** through shared exploration
- **Integrate with Haven Control Room** star mapping program

### How It Works
1. You explore planets in No Man's Sky
2. You submit discoveries using `/discovery-report`
3. The Keeper analyzes and archives your finding
4. Patterns automatically emerge when similar discoveries are submitted
5. Community investigates mysteries together

## 🎯 How Pattern Detection Works

### The Archive Mind

The Keeper constantly monitors all submissions, analyzing them across **5 dimensions**:

#### 1. Type Coherence (30% weight)
*Do discoveries share the same type?*
- 5 ancient bone discoveries = high coherence
- Mixed types = low coherence

#### 2. Regional Coherence (25% weight)
*Are they in the same galactic region?*
- All in "Euclid Core" = high coherence
- Spread across galaxies = low coherence

#### 3. Location Coherence (20% weight)
*Are they on the same planets/systems?*
- Multiple discoveries on same planet = high coherence
- Different systems = lower coherence

#### 4. Temporal Coherence (15% weight)
*Were they found close together in time?*
- All within 1 week = high coherence
- Months apart = lower coherence

#### 5. Narrative Coherence (10% weight)
*Do descriptions share similar themes?*
- Similar keywords and concepts = higher coherence
- Unrelated descriptions = lower coherence

### Pattern Confidence Threshold

The Keeper requires **60% overall confidence** before declaring a pattern:

```
Confidence = (Type×0.3 + Region×0.25 + Location×0.2 + Temporal×0.15 + Narrative×0.1)

If Confidence ≥ 60% AND Count ≥ 3 discoveries:
  → Pattern Detected!
```

### Pattern Alerts

When patterns emerge, The Keeper posts alerts:

```
🌀 Pattern Convergence Detected

The fragments align. A pattern emerges from the noise.

📊 Pattern Matrix:
├─ Similar Discoveries: 5
├─ Confidence Level: 73.2%
├─ Temporal Spread: 14 days
├─ Primary Region: Euclid Core
└─ Discovery Type: Ancient Remains

🔮 Significance:
The pattern solidifies across multiple dimensional echoes.
This is no mere coincidence—intelligence is at work.

🎯 Next Phase:
Investigation thread opened. Travelers encouraged to 
contribute additional evidence and theories.
```

### Investigation Threads

High-confidence patterns (Tier 3+) automatically create investigation threads where:
- Community discusses theories
- Additional discoveries are submitted
- Collaborative analysis occurs
- The Keeper provides insights
- Patterns are eventually resolved with lore reveals

## 🗺️ Haven Integration

### What is Haven Control Room?

Haven Control Room is a **desktop star mapping program** that lets you:
- Map star systems with full planetary data
- Track coordinates and regions
- Export/import system catalogs
- Visualize your explored galaxy

### How The Keeper Integrates

**The Flow:**
```
Haven Control Room → The Keeper Bot → Back to Haven

1. Create star systems in Haven
2. Export system data to JSON
3. Keeper reads Haven data
4. Discovery dropdowns populate with your systems
5. Submit discoveries in Discord
6. Export discoveries back to Haven
7. Enhanced map with lore annotations
```

### Using Haven Systems in Discord

When you use `/discovery-report`, The Keeper reads your Haven star map data and presents:
- **System Selection** - Dropdown of your mapped systems
- **Location Selection** - Planets, moons, space locations from that system
- **Coordinate Integration** - Uses Haven's coordinate system
- **Region Awareness** - Pattern detection uses Haven's regions

### Without Haven Integration

The bot works perfectly fine without Haven! If not integrated:
- Manual system/location entry
- Standalone archive system
- Pattern detection still functional
- All features available

To enable later, place Haven data file at expected location.
