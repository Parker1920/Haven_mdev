## 💡 KEY FEATURES

### ✅ Real NMS Integration
Every discovery in the actual game becomes part of your lore. Bones, logs, ruins, creatures, technology—all feed the narrative.

### ✅ Pattern-Driven Storytelling
The story emerges from patterns in player discoveries, not from pre-written plot. Genuinely organic narrative development.

### ✅ Community-Driven
80 members exploring → thousands of discoveries → your lore team weaves them into arcs → community engages with mystery.

### ✅ Long-Term Engagement
Mysteries unfold over weeks/months. Not one-off events. Sustainable ongoing narrative.

### ✅ Low Admin Overhead
Use templates, follow frameworks. Responses write themselves once you understand the system.

### ✅ Scalable
Works for 80 members. Works for 500+ members. Just more discoveries, more patterns, richer narrative.

## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: What if no one reports discoveries?**
A: Post challenges/quests. "Find me 3 examples of [specific thing]." Encourage participation.

**Q: How long until we have a "complete" story?**
A: Never. It's designed to evolve indefinitely. Mystery deepens, new questions emerge.

**Q: Can players break the lore?**
A: Not really. The Keeper interprets everything. Contradictions become mysteries.

**Q: How much admin time does this take?**
A: 2-3 hours weekly. Process discoveries, write responses, track patterns.

A: Absolutely. Any game with discoverable lore/items works.
